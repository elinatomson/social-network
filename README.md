# social-network

## Project Description
This is a social network page containing following features:
- Profile
- Followers
- Posts
- Groups
- Events
- Notifications
- Chats

In the project I have used:
- React for the frontend
- Golang for the backend
- Docker
- Sqlite3

## How to use
- You should have Docker installed. 
- To build images and run the containers type in your terminal: docker compose up
- Then open localhost:3000 in your browser to visit the page.

## For auditing
The audit questions are [here](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/social-network/audit)
According to the audit questions you should register your own user, but one premade user as well if you need it:
- email: someone@hotmail.com
- Password: Tere1
